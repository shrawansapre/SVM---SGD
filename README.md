MNIST1 is a benchmark data set for classification. The full MNIST consists of 70,000 gray-scale images with size 28-by-28, each of which contains a digit from 0 to 9.


In the experiments, I use a part of it for binary classification. I have also used the raw pixel as the feature vector xi. Therefore, the feature dimension, d = 28 Ã— 28 = 784.
